abstract={Emotions are highly useful to model human behavior being at the core of what makes us human. Today, people abundantly express and share emotions through social media. Technological advancements in such platforms enable sharing opinions or expressing any specific emotions towards what others have shared, mainly in the form of textual data. This entails an interesting arena for analysis; as to whether there is a disconnect between the writer's intended emotion and the reader's perception of textual content. In this paper, we present experiments for Readers' Emotion Detection through multi-target regression settings by exploring a Bi-LSTM-based Attention model, where our major intention is to analyze the interpretability and effectiveness of the deep learning model for the task. To conduct experiments, we procure two extensive datasets REN-10k and RENh-4k, apart from using a popular benchmark dataset from SemEval-2007. We perform a two-phase experimental evaluation, first being various coarse-grained and fine-grained evaluations of our model performance in comparison with several baselines belonging to different categories of emotion detection, viz., deep learning, lexicon based, and classical machine learning. Secondly, we evaluate model behavior towards readers' emotion detection assessing attention maps generated by the model through devising a novel set of qualitative and quantitative metrics. The first phase of experiments shows that our Bi-LSTM + Attention model significantly outperforms all baselines. The second analysis reveals that emotions may be correlated to specific words as well as named entities.},

First, we collect and release a large dataset of 34,737 articles that were manually annotated for political ideology {--}left, center, or right{--}, which is well-balanced across both topics and media. We further use a challenging experimental setup where the test examples come from media that were not seen during training, which prevents the model from learning to detect the source of the target news article instead of predicting its political ideology. From a modeling perspective, we propose an adversarial media adaptation, as well as a specially adapted triplet loss. We further add background information about the source, and we show that it is quite helpful for improving article-level prediction. Our experimental results show very sizable improvements over using state-of-the-art pre-trained Transformers in this challenging setup.",

abstract={Recently, a new form of structured summary on scientific papers is explored by grouping cited text spans from the reference paper. Its primary goal is to generate summaries based on the cited paper itself. Previously, traditional scientific summarization focused on citation-based methods by aggregating all citances that cite one unique paper without doing content-based citation analysis, while sometimes citations might differ between researchers or time slots. By investigating original text spans where scholars cited, the new method can reflect exact contributions of reference papers more. Therefore, how to identify cited text spans accurately becomes the first important problem to solve. Generally, it can be converted into finding the sentences in reference paper that is more similar with citation sentences. Taking it as a classification task, we investigate the potential of four actions to improve identification performance. Firstly, feature selections are conducted carefully according to multi-classifiers. Secondly, we apply sampling-based algorithms to preprocess class-imbalanced datasets. Since we integrated results via a weighted voting system, the third action is tuning parameters like, voting weights for multi-classifiers integration or running settings to see if we can improve performance further. Evaluation results show effectiveness of each action and demonstrate that researchers can take these actions for more accurate cited text spans identification when doing scientific summarization.},

The dataset addresses the lack of code-mixed datasets with annotated offensive spans by extending annotations of existing code-mixed offensive language identification datasets. It provides span annotations for Tamil-English and Kannada-English code-mixed comments posted by users on YouTube social media. Overall the dataset consists of 4786 Tamil-English comments with 6202 annotated spans and 1097 Kannada-English comments with 1641 annotated spans, each annotated by two different annotators. We further present some of our baseline experimental results on the developed dataset, thereby eliciting research in under-resourced languages, leading to an essential step towards semi-automated content moderation in Dravidian languages.
